### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anuj. I've been learning to build web applications. I started with building REST APIs and then moved on to build a supporting front-end for one of the APIs.

*I'm currently looking for an Internship as a Full Stack Developer or Backend Developer. I like building products, and want to work with a Team to build  products that create impact in people's lives.*

In my journey so far, I've learned to use Python and JavaScript for basic programming. I've built REST APIs using Flask (A Python Framework), and with that, I used SQLite as Database and Heroku for hosting my projects.

For planning, testing, and documenting my APIs, I've used Postman. And used GitHub for storing the code.
